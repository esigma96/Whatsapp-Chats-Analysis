01/10/2022, 18:54 - Emmanuel Enyo-ojo Amedu: The first line of code you wrote, did it work?

01/10/2022, 18:59 - Kami: Don’t shy away buddy. Express yourself.

02/10/2022, 07:32 - Alozie Chidindu: The west is wining the war in Ukraine, btw. But only Ukrainian blood and Russia blood is spilt

02/10/2022, 08:12 - CraftLab: On Sunday fa
02/10/2022, 08:46 - Alozie Chidindu: Yup
02/10/2022, 08:58 - .: Even in your Country, you are cheap labour. My point is, the average American don't know or even have anything to do with the Military Industrial Complex. To the average American, war is war and its bad. To the upper class rich folks, war is an avenue to make more money. Its just business to them.

Same thing applies to your own country, Rich folks here don't care about you. They make decisions that favor them alone. If they had opportunities to make money through war, we would be a millitary power and a war mongering country too.
Let's not blame a whole race for what a selected few are doing.
02/10/2022, 08:59 - Alozie Chidindu: Average American are more involved in their country affairs than you'd ever imagined
02/10/2022, 09:00 - Alozie Chidindu: A selected what, dude read your history...generations upon generations doing the same annex shit and you're saying a few
02/10/2022, 09:01 - Alozie Chidindu: I bet you would be easily manipulated by females, a few tears, batting eyes and gas lighting and you think you're in the wrong. Shhhhhhiiiiiiittttttt
02/10/2022, 09:03 - CraftLab: This is totally unrelated and uncalled for.

I want a fair fight boys, no hits from or below the belt
02/10/2022, 09:03 - Alozie Chidindu: Lollllll
02/10/2022, 09:03 - .: A selected few steal money here in Nigeria generation after generation, would you say it's every Nigerian that is a thief?
02/10/2022, 09:04 - Alozie Chidindu: It is so common like
02/10/2022, 09:04 - CraftLab: With that said, women can be manipulative, so remember to stay wicked men
02/10/2022, 09:04 - CraftLab: Stay wicked! 👍🏾
02/10/2022, 09:04 - Alozie Chidindu: My boss idowu said this and I concur, every Nigerian is a thief if only given the opportunity

02/10/2022, 09:05 - Alozie Chidindu: Stay sharp...we all know niggas can't. Even samson fell
02/10/2022, 09:05 - Alozie Chidindu: Alexander fell
02/10/2022, 09:05 - Alozie Chidindu: David fell
02/10/2022, 09:05 - CraftLab: <Media omitted>
02/10/2022, 09:05 - Alozie Chidindu: Every great man fell
02/10/2022, 09:06 - Alozie Chidindu: So you will fall too
02/10/2022, 09:06 - CraftLab: Because they lacked a prophet, a leader, a visionary.

Now we have them plenty. The gospel according to Shola, Future and other Alfalfa males
02/10/2022, 09:06 - Alozie Chidindu: Bro....have you been hunted by a woman?
02/10/2022, 09:07 - CraftLab: Speaking of which, I want to do class on retaining your manhood, 50k for registration
02/10/2022, 09:07 - Alozie Chidindu: She will get u
02/10/2022, 09:07 - Alozie Chidindu: Never fell don't need it

02/10/2022, 09:08 - Alozie Chidindu: Bro, oh God...bro bro bro...
02/10/2022, 09:08 - .: Baba see the people behinde the military industrial complex are the people that win Elections, they sponsor candidates. Their say is more powerful than that of the average American. See ehn this thing is plenty... Let's not get into it this Sunday abeg
02/10/2022, 09:09 - Alozie Chidindu: You're right...but you're forgetting they get approval from the people
02/10/2022, 09:09 - CraftLab: Get into it please.

We're here and we're ready
02/10/2022, 09:09 - Alozie Chidindu: Senate passes bills his constituents favor

02/10/2022, 09:10 - Alozie Chidindu: U go against then the people rip you...its been done before and is still is
02/10/2022, 09:11 - Alozie Chidindu: Its
02/10/2022, 11:14 - Governor Tee: Sighs..
02/10/2022, 11:15 - .: Yeah but don't forget what's sold to the average American, they're supporting Ukraine against Russian aggression. 
While the average American believes this is an act of good will,
The likes of Lockheed Martins and BAE systems, General Dynamics and co. makes more money off it. 

The same set of people control the media. They paint any narrative they want. The average American is just a pawn in this game bro.
02/10/2022, 11:16 - Governor Tee: Because of what they sell to them
What the media will portray will be different from what's going on beneath
02/10/2022, 11:18 - .: I bet you, even in Russia you have that same set of people. They're everywhere.
02/10/2022, 11:20 - Sage: You deleted this message
02/10/2022, 11:24 - Sage: Really funny hw we think the West and US have a perfect system.

02/10/2022, 11:32 - Ore: What is this access more app size ffs
02/10/2022, 11:32 - Ore: When it’s not call of duty😭
02/10/2022, 11:32 - Alozie Chidindu: Aren't they selling the same narrative to the world too, people like me who chose too think for themselves nko, so Americans can't think for themselves
02/10/2022, 11:34 - Alozie Chidindu: As it has always been..
Your wife/gf is only with you for personal interest...which may change (hence I'm pro divorce)
02/10/2022, 11:35 - Alozie Chidindu: When it's no more mutual
02/10/2022, 11:36 - Alozie Chidindu: Jesus David what are you typing
02/10/2022, 11:38 - Alozie Chidindu: @2348129155879  please you're killing me with anxiety
02/10/2022, 11:39 - David UBN: People are shaped by their experiences. Your level of exposure to the disinformation and propaganda cannot be compared to the institutionalised campaigns targeted at the average American right from birth.

Your perspective is also shaped by your history, being on the other divide of the "cultural" war so it is relatively easy for you to choose to see beyond the popular narrative.

This does not absolve the American of the responsibility of original thought, I am just saying it is not as simple and clear cut as merely choosing to be rational.
02/10/2022, 11:39 - Alozie Chidindu: Ffs this better be longer than Paul's epistle to the corinthians
02/10/2022, 11:39 - Alozie Chidindu: Thank you
02/10/2022, 11:40 - Alozie Chidindu: It's not simple but it can be done. See beyond the smokescreen
02/10/2022, 11:40 - Alozie Chidindu: I'm very controversial on so many topics @2348129155879 I pride myself in the truth.
02/10/2022, 11:41 - David UBN: Yeah, it can be done but it comes at a very high price a lot of people are either unwilling or completely unable to pay.
02/10/2022, 11:41 - Alozie Chidindu: I see beyond
02/10/2022, 11:41 - Alozie Chidindu: Unable??? Nah unwilling
02/10/2022, 11:41 - Alozie Chidindu: Everybody wants to be liked, loved, worshiped
02/10/2022, 11:42 - Alozie Chidindu: It's natural...human God complex
02/10/2022, 11:42 - Alozie Chidindu: Very common with public figures
02/10/2022, 11:42 - David UBN: Yes, unable. Not as in complete lack of ability but total absence of the resources necessary to do so and survive the aftermath.
02/10/2022, 11:43 - Alozie Chidindu: What resources was I given, I simply made a very uncomfortable decision to be objective in all, no matter how disadvantageous
02/10/2022, 11:43 - David UBN: It is not that simple, we are all linked in some way or form. This enriches our experience as human beings but it also means we can do a lot of damage to each other.
02/10/2022, 11:43 - Alozie Chidindu: It's not easy yes, but we all have the ability
02/10/2022, 11:43 - Alozie Chidindu: True
02/10/2022, 11:44 - Alozie Chidindu: Very
02/10/2022, 11:44 - Alozie Chidindu: So fear of hurting your bffs you turn a blind eye
02/10/2022, 11:44 - Alozie Chidindu: Cool
02/10/2022, 11:44 - David UBN: Your very vocal misgivings about the West and their politics do not have the same social and material consequences here in Nigeria as they would in America.
02/10/2022, 11:45 - Alozie Chidindu: U think I would not say this of my visa is at stake?
02/10/2022, 11:46 - David UBN: They would also do very little to rattle the core of your identity on a personal level.
02/10/2022, 11:46 - Alozie Chidindu: Misgivings??? Really all I've said can be fact checked. I read then relate
02/10/2022, 11:46 - Alozie Chidindu: <Media omitted>
02/10/2022, 11:47 - Alozie Chidindu: Care to expand on this
02/10/2022, 11:47 - David UBN: I am not implying your submissions are wrong, just qualifying your disposition towards the West.
02/10/2022, 11:48 - Alozie Chidindu: Use appropriate adjectives bro
02/10/2022, 11:48 - Alozie Chidindu: 👆🏽
02/10/2022, 11:49 - David UBN: I meant it in the sense of distrust, I will try to be more careful with my phrasing.
02/10/2022, 11:49 - Alozie Chidindu: Lol thanks
02/10/2022, 11:49 - Alozie Chidindu: Explain this
02/10/2022, 11:50 - David UBN: Maybe privately, I would need to use an example that won't go over well on a public platform.
02/10/2022, 11:50 - Alozie Chidindu: It's a thing you come to terms with if your BFF steals your millions
02/10/2022, 11:50 - Alozie Chidindu: Dms. Then 🥳
02/10/2022, 11:53 - David UBN: The basic summary is our identities are like our personal story, complete with the archetypal characterizations of hero and villain. 

A massive shift to the structure your personal story is akin to taking a sledgehammer to your psyche, it is not pleasant and the natural instinct is to protect yourself.
02/10/2022, 11:53 - David UBN: Sure.
02/10/2022, 11:54 - Alozie Chidindu: <Media omitted>

02/10/2022, 11:55 - Alozie Chidindu: Anybody or is everyone confused too
02/10/2022, 12:21 - +234 703 228 1127: 😂 Maybe they used Electron to build it.
elcetron apps and large bundle size are 5&6.
02/10/2022, 12:23 - Nonso: Abeg make all of ona gerrit...if you can't contribute something positive to this country and better ona no go reason western people
02/10/2022, 12:23 - Governor Tee: I don't think anyone believe they do


But I'd choose their system over the Nazis anyday anytime
02/10/2022, 12:30 - CraftLab: @2348129155879 - Of course.

It's the nature of man to shield himself from all forms of unpleasantness, just as we would withdraw from the heat of a fire, many will withdraw from the searing acknowledgement of either they or their country's inadequacies to embrace a spoon-fed ideology.

But still you can't completely do away with @2347058563520's opinion in that for those who choose to see beyond the veil the chance to push forward in search of the complete truth is always available regardless of status, society, gender or any such disparity.

Logic, curiousity and true sight are freely given to all, if you live all your life in mediocrity or disinformation in a way it's your own damn fault.
02/10/2022, 12:33 - Alozie Chidindu: I think I'm in love
02/10/2022, 12:33 - Alozie Chidindu: <Media omitted>
02/10/2022, 12:33 - David UBN: Again, I believe everyone should be accountable for their beliefs and actions but I cannot in good faith, knowing what I know about the world, agree that the capacity to rise above "mediocrity and disinformation" is equally available to us all.
02/10/2022, 12:35 - David UBN: It is simply not true within any context, not even biologically.
02/10/2022, 12:38 - David UBN: And I think it's important that we all recognize that even your most sacred, most personally significant belief is someone else's scaled hurdle on the path to enlightenment.
02/10/2022, 12:44 - David UBN: It's easy to claim we all have the ability to choose and learn, yeah it's a really tidy sentiment but it is just that, a sentiment and it clashes hard with reality.
02/10/2022, 12:44 - Alozie Chidindu: Every body will sly
02/10/2022, 12:46 - David UBN: The leeway to question, the opportunity and resources to learn, the freedom to choose

None of these are available or accessible in equal proportion to every human being on Earth.
02/10/2022, 12:48 - David UBN: To believe otherwise, 

in spite of everything that has happened in our history, continues to happen today, and will continue to happen until an unforeseeable day,

is to choose to believe a lie.
02/10/2022, 12:49 - David UBN: Even the ability to learn is not equally available.
02/10/2022, 12:51 - CraftLab: Here's why I disagree - I mention three concepts earlier namely Logic, curiousity and true sight.

These are freely dispensed to each individual at birth although I will concede that our ability and willingness to shape this may to some extent or the other be influenced by society, however, no amount of hemming and hawwing or societal construct can take these gifts away, only our willingness to use them.
02/10/2022, 12:52 - David UBN: Your premise is already flawed. 

Logic, curiosity and true sight are not freely dispensed at birth. Neurocognitive disorders exist.
02/10/2022, 12:53 - CraftLab: If you allow society to determine what you believe as true irrespective of your possession of these three, then tha is you choosing to surrender the burden of thought and choice and for that you're just as guilty as those who want to take it from you 

For example, you don't need a government decree to know that jungle justice is a terrible thing - we are born with an innate sense of right and wrong that revolts at the first view of it rather we become accustomed to it over time and then come to accept it as what is obtainable
02/10/2022, 12:54 - David UBN: And again, more often than not, your willingness to use whatever "gifts" you may think you possess means very little in the face of overwhelming force and means intended to manipulate and deny you that right.
02/10/2022, 12:54 - Alozie Chidindu: <Media omitted>
02/10/2022, 12:54 - CraftLab: Speak to those who have these neurocognitive disorders and you will find out that they see even clearer than most of us.

True sight is not about seeing, its about understanding and having a conscience that can judge between right or wrong
02/10/2022, 12:56 - David UBN: I'm sorry but speaking as someone who spent close to 4 years studying around this topic, this is demonstrably false.
02/10/2022, 12:56 - CraftLab: No matter how structured a dictatorship is, there are always rebels.

No matter how perfect oppression is, there are always outliers 

The human nature cannot be repressed and there is always a choice.

You may choose not to exercise that freedom to choose, due to fear of adverse or even lethal results, but deep down that choice exists
02/10/2022, 12:57 - CraftLab: Which leads me to question what you were learning. 😌
02/10/2022, 12:58 - David UBN: That studying in a Nigerian University is a colossal waste of time, energy and brain cells.
02/10/2022, 12:59 - Alozie Chidindu: I felt shot at
02/10/2022, 12:59 - CraftLab: I have learnt actual solid life lessons from autistic people (admittedly that is the only neurocognitive disorders I have been directly exposed to) and I'll tell you for a fact, they do see clearer than you or me
02/10/2022, 13:01 - David UBN: I'm glad you admitted this is the only clinical population within that diagnostic area you have interacted with because I can tell you for free that they do not represent the cluster.

Even the people you met cannot give you a full picture of the diverse ways in which autism presents.
02/10/2022, 13:01 - Alozie Chidindu: True
02/10/2022, 13:02 - CraftLab: So you're going to tell me that there are disorders that remove the slot for logic, curiousity and true sight all at once?

Give me one such example
02/10/2022, 13:07 - David UBN: Choice is a very fickle and paradoxical thing. Look at the picture you painted in your last paragraph.

Is it really a choice in the face of overwhelming force?

The woman who chooses death in defiance of a cruel violation to her person made a choice in shallowest sense if its meaning but is it truly a choice?
02/10/2022, 13:08 - David UBN: *the shallowest sense of its meaning
02/10/2022, 13:09 - Kayode: _fickle and paradoxical_

Haaaa lemme come don here abeg
02/10/2022, 13:09 - Kayode: <Media omitted>
02/10/2022, 13:09 - David UBN: I can't give you an example for something that doesn't exist

There's no slot in anyone's brain for logic and you have yet to define what you mean by true sight
02/10/2022, 13:11 - David UBN: In fact, you might have to explain what you consider logic, curiosity and true sight as distinct concepts/abilities to mean before I can attempt to give you an answer
02/10/2022, 13:11 - David UBN: Kayode I've seen you type before o, please nau😩
02/10/2022, 13:14 - CraftLab: Don't downplay a person's choices fam.

Regardless of how substantive the effect of that choice may be, and or its resultant events, a choice is a choice regardless, and that woman in your example has made as solid a choice to me as does anyone who topples a corrupt regime.
02/10/2022, 13:15 - CraftLab: We'll visit this conversation at a later date, I'm too tired and hungry to carry on an intellectual discourse for too long.
02/10/2022, 13:18 - David UBN: Then we have very different understandings of the concept of choice and since it's the underlying principle behind the root of our disagreement, it makes it that much harder to reach a concensus.
02/10/2022, 13:19 - David UBN: Not in person sha, I am allergic to physical conflict.

02/10/2022, 18:32 - Sage: Seriously...

Seun.

U just stumbled on this.
Every man should have a business,  and Peter Obi having one just to evade tax is no biggie
02/10/2022, 18:34 - Sage: I assure u 

He didn't. 

Pandora papers dat came out 1 yr from now.

Which Nigerian politician does not have an offshore investment
02/10/2022, 18:35 - Sage: *1  year ago
02/10/2022, 18:35 - Seun Adetoyi: Tax evation no big deal?
Is it illegal? Yes
Should I not be concerned a political office holder did so?
Yes, I should 
Was it only tax evasion?
No 
What about the incomplete declaration of assets?
02/10/2022, 18:36 - Seun Adetoyi: Sad we call crimes common in this clime!

Well our society doesn’t give us so much option I guess
02/10/2022, 18:37 - Seun Adetoyi: Peace out ✌️
02/10/2022, 18:37 - Seun Adetoyi: I did 
I wouldn’t share it in the first place if I didn’t
02/10/2022, 18:39 - Mariam UBN: Pandora papers investigation came out a couple of years ago, a lot of politicians were named, not only Obi. I don't wonder why Premium Times chose to focus on only him.
02/10/2022, 18:40 - Seun Adetoyi: Well, some of the ill thingy we deal with as a society that we call journalism
02/10/2022, 18:40 - Mariam UBN: Do we expect any of the candidates to be saints?
It is sad we are left to choose with the lesser evil, but if you want to share the wrongdoings of any candidate, please go ahead and share for all.
02/10/2022, 18:40 - Seun Adetoyi: Hope you asked those questions too with those ones who dig on Atiku and BAT
02/10/2022, 18:41 - Mariam UBN: You'd be honest to admit our media houses have been quiet about the wrongdoings of these two, except DH, Sahara and Gazette.
02/10/2022, 18:43 - Mariam UBN: More scrutiny is placed on Obi, we all know that. What happened when he was the governor of Anambra, what role did he play in the atrocities committed by SARS in Anambra? 
He doesn't shy away from there question, does he?
02/10/2022, 18:43 - Mariam UBN: But the other two you mentioned, are they even present at events, not to mention answering questions.
02/10/2022, 18:43 - Mariam UBN: We don't want another 8 years of begging to see our president, or getting a live interview from our president.

02/10/2022, 19:45 - Sage: Meanwhile 

This is a valid point. 

He should have declared the asset. 

But at that time,  Nigerians were not made to pay tax on proceeds from Foreign owned assets.

And since the Biz was situated in a Tax haven. Tax avoidance is a strategy every business man employs.

As to y d asset was not declared, I wouldn't defend him. He is at fault. 

But nevertheless this doesn't mean BAT is the perfect man for the job.

I still support restructuring. Not a new president.
02/10/2022, 19:52 - Seun Adetoyi: I’ve not campaigned for BAT nor Atiku
We all read BAT drug runs so should we not read this too?

03/10/2022, 20:00 - +234 703 228 1127: You are missing the point, can you code inside the alpine image? You can only move files there, any modifications to those files will have to be done on your host machine and then you move it there.

05/10/2022, 18:15 - Kami: He’s a strong frame to look up to. He can be your leader. And you’ll obey. Femininity is complimentary.
05/10/2022, 18:15 - Alozie Chidindu: Wtf bro
05/10/2022, 18:16 - Rosemary UB: Nope...
05/10/2022, 18:16 - Alozie Chidindu: Exactly
05/10/2022, 18:16 - Rosemary UB: I look at my bank account
05/10/2022, 18:16 - Kami: Real nigga talk. You can trust him to make some guided suggestions for you right?
05/10/2022, 18:16 - Rosemary UB: I look at my dreams, my ambitions
05/10/2022, 18:16 - Kami: 😂

05/10/2022, 18:17 - Rosemary UB: Subtly i look at runs girl's lifestyle and tell myself i wont be just an object of gratification
05/10/2022, 18:17 - Rosemary UB: I am more than my reproductive system
05/10/2022, 18:17 - Alozie Chidindu: Hmmmm....some deep sated issue here, I can feel it.
05/10/2022, 18:18 - Rosemary UB: I look at my younger sister and the standards i have to set for her
05/10/2022, 18:19 - Rosemary UB: As well as all my female cousins...
05/10/2022, 18:19 - Kami: You’re only enforcing what it means to live under masculine environment
05/10/2022, 18:19 - Alozie Chidindu: @2347061061033
05/10/2022, 18:19 - Rosemary UB: Nope.....
05/10/2022, 18:20 - Kami: <Media omitted>
05/10/2022, 18:20 - Rosemary UB: Im just letting the world know that being feminine is not just being a support system, its means being a great follower makes you an even better leader...
05/10/2022, 18:23 - Kami: Definitely. That means you misconstrue what is meant by the feminine. You can be a strong badass independent woman and still be feminine.
05/10/2022, 18:23 - Alozie Chidindu: Only if all women were like you, I'd finally realise my most sacred dream and ambition of being a house husband/painter
05/10/2022, 18:23 - Alozie Chidindu: <Media omitted>
05/10/2022, 18:23 - Kami: There’s women like that homeboy. But they not perfect either. They still get shege to show. Because no one is perfect. Pause that dream😂

05/10/2022, 18:24 - Rosemary UB: A weak man doesn’t build houses every where he goes to,  never drink, smoke or womanize and is even a better prayer warrior than any bodys mother can ever be to them.... 
A weak father doesnt forsake his qualification exam to run from hospital to hospital for his sick child
05/10/2022, 18:25 - Kami: I could hook you up but you got whore flowing thru yo veins.

05/10/2022, 18:26 - Kami: I think what I’ll emphasize above all is being self aware. That’s where weak men lack it the most. You can’t fix a problem you don’t know you have.
05/10/2022, 18:26 - Alozie Chidindu: She mad at society bro
05/10/2022, 18:27 - Alozie Chidindu: @2347061061033 quick question are you driving?

05/10/2022, 18:30 - Alozie Chidindu: Yea, you hate the construct
05/10/2022, 18:30 - Rosemary UB: Sorry oh, this is what i am stating... period.....
05/10/2022, 18:30 - Alozie Chidindu: Lol
05/10/2022, 18:31 - Rosemary UB: Yes
05/10/2022, 18:31 - Alozie Chidindu: I hate it too, I want to be feminine
05/10/2022, 18:31 - Rosemary UB: Lol....
05/10/2022, 18:31 - Kami: Weyrey😂

05/10/2022, 18:32 - Alozie Chidindu: Really
05/10/2022, 18:32 - Kami: Cap 🧢
05/10/2022, 18:32 - Kami: LGTV genders have it easy
05/10/2022, 18:32 - Alozie Chidindu: I get night tuck tuck cook and clean and take care of junior. Then have a fling while honeys at work
05/10/2022, 18:33 - Alozie Chidindu: I want soap opera life
05/10/2022, 18:33 - Kami: 😂
05/10/2022, 18:34 - Rosemary UB: Goodluck with that...
05/10/2022, 18:35 - Rosemary UB: Till youre killed for being confused about your gender

05/10/2022, 18:35 - Alozie Chidindu: This is brutal you're really masculine
05/10/2022, 18:39 - Rosemary UB: Right now, we'll just enjoy the best of both worlds...
05/10/2022, 18:41 - FAOK: <Media omitted>
05/10/2022, 18:45 - CraftLab: Wait what?

Not drinking, or smoking or womanizing makes you weak?

Is that what I'm seeing here?
05/10/2022, 18:47 - Rosemary UB: The message is passed... you know what I'm trying to say
05/10/2022, 18:47 - CraftLab: No I don't.

That's why I'm asking
05/10/2022, 18:48 - CraftLab: Because if this is what you're saying, then that's wrong.
05/10/2022, 18:50 - Rosemary UB: Meant to say , strong... nna... e pele
05/10/2022, 18:52 - Rosemary UB: Omo typo and typing straight from my head...

Okay i meant that my father csnt be classed as a weak man because, he was there for us, he was not a drunk, he was not a womanizer, he was not a smoker, he would jeopardize everything for his kids...
05/10/2022, 18:54 - Alozie Chidindu: 👆🏽
05/10/2022, 18:54 - Rosemary UB: Cant call him weak... because his strength empowered us to be better humans... 

Weak fathers are the selfish ones, the ones that prefers to be served than served, the ones that the children despise...
05/10/2022, 18:54 - Rosemary UB: E pele, my dear... i totally get the point now
05/10/2022, 18:55 - Alozie Chidindu: An intelligent woman
05/10/2022, 18:56 - Rosemary UB: <Media omitted>
05/10/2022, 19:05 - Rosemary UB: Thanks @2348172153423 and @2347058563520  for the correction... 


But yeah... thats the truth... its not to marry wife put for house... are you a great father or husband?.... the one that even while your kids leave home, the values that you instill in them never depart from them... but if you marry a bad woman, no matter how good you are, it takes prayers and grace for you not to have "weak children" 

According to mathematics
Hence strong descendants are  functions of two strong parents... (+ × += +)

Weak descendants are functions of one strong parent and a weak one (+ × -= - )

And in rare cases... strong descendants are functions of 2 weak parents... (- × - = +)

Thank you🤣🤣🤣🤣


Talking about this makes me miss my Dad...and my home...  ✌🏼

If you're not already towards the end of 3MB at this time you're screwed.

06/10/2022, 06:51 - Mariam UBN: You get to work through Adeniji?
06/10/2022, 06:51 - CraftLab: Just check if you can get mattress in the traffic, then get some sleep
06/10/2022, 06:52 - CraftLab: Shebi you have laptop? You can work from 3MB na
06/10/2022, 06:52 - Nonso👑: A truck fell this morning and is causing massive traffic
06/10/2022, 06:54 - Mariam UBN: Yep
The traffic is bad, I'm currently in it
06/10/2022, 06:55 - Mariam UBN: Tried it once. It's okay but the route isn't straightforward
06/10/2022, 06:55 - Mariam UBN: <Media omitted>
06/10/2022, 06:56 - CraftLab: Yeah I passed that on the way here.

Bicycles and gas cylinders. I sure hope those cylinders aren't full sha
06/10/2022, 06:56 - CraftLab: Eeya.

You will come out, eventually
06/10/2022, 06:56 - Nonso👑: I hope so too
06/10/2022, 06:57 - CraftLab: See what I get for trying to be nice?

Humans don't deserve love and attention 🙄
06/10/2022, 06:58 - CraftLab: On the positive side if there's an explosion you get a chance to do a cool slo-mo walk-without-looking-back video
06/10/2022, 06:58 - Mariam UBN: Nice indeed
06/10/2022, 06:58 - Mariam UBN: Why risk your life when you can achieve this with photoshop
06/10/2022, 06:59 - CraftLab: It won't be as awesome and it won't be a video
06/10/2022, 07:00 - CraftLab: @2348167972949 - Don't listen to her. There could be an explosion and you can make that video
06/10/2022, 07:01 - Mariam UBN: <Media omitted>
06/10/2022, 07:02 - CraftLab: @2348186797042 -  You're just jealous because you can't make the video
06/10/2022, 07:02 - Nonso👑: There won't be an explosion. The impact and casualties will be untold
06/10/2022, 07:02 - CraftLab: God forbid that there is one but if there was, at least you know what to do
06/10/2022, 07:03 - CraftLab: Asake's "Organise" would slap as a soundtrack for it
06/10/2022, 07:04 - Nonso👑: Human being 🤨
06/10/2022, 07:04 - CraftLab: Just watching out for you bro 💜
06/10/2022, 07:05 - CraftLab: Remember, Organise is the soundtrack.

Also, if you have shades, wear them
06/10/2022, 07:06 - CraftLab: It would be even more perfect if @2348129155879 and @2348140796653 could join in the video
06/10/2022, 07:06 - CraftLab: Given how accident prone he is these days, I have a feeling @2347058563520 would find his way there as well
06/10/2022, 07:07 - David UBN: I've been at my desk since 6:45, sorry to your wicked dreams.
06/10/2022, 07:08 - Governor Tee: What if he get caught up in the explosion
God forbid o
06/10/2022, 07:08 - CraftLab: Please na.

06/10/2022, 07:08 - CraftLab: Also why are you resuming by 6:45? What is wrong with you? 😫
06/10/2022, 07:09 - Nonso👑: He won't be caught up bro. Amen
06/10/2022, 07:09 - David UBN: The same thing that's wrong with everyone living in Lagos
06/10/2022, 07:09 - CraftLab: Amen 🙏
06/10/2022, 07:09 - Governor Tee: Seems they've revealed your KPI to you
06/10/2022, 07:10 - CraftLab: Also you could just pray that there is no explosion but humans are naturally selfish, I understand
06/10/2022, 07:10 - David UBN: You mean you haven't asked?

07/10/2022, 09:17 - Josh Biz UBN: @2349022470164 and others, your Peter Obi has not been be able to share any document of significance towards projections and milestones for development of the nation.
07/10/2022, 09:17 - Emmanuel Enyo-ojo Amedu: Besides which government will not pay attention to economy, does that even make sense saying it
07/10/2022, 09:19 - Emmanuel Enyo-ojo Amedu: Get your facts right bro. The failure of Buhari is the failure of Apc
07/10/2022, 09:20 - Josh Biz UBN: @2349022470164 and others Maybe you guys should readup and you would learn that third world nations that who are developed countries today ran the country from a business stand point.

07/10/2022, 09:32 - Josh Biz UBN: Nigerians have fractured perspective on what our economy prospects should be.

07/10/2022, 10:17 - Armstrong: What's so funny now is... We have three presidential candidates but only one has been granting interviews and answering the hard questions...

Tinubu and atiku have not granted any interview or stood in front of live audience to talk and be asked the real questions.

This man has been begging you all doubters and nay sayers to please go and verify. 

This man has been the only one answering the pertinent questions.

This is not fair bros. This is the first time in the history of Nigeria that such intelligent and well accomplished man is running for presidency. 

Please I beg you all not to ever compare a man like obi who has served in high capabilities and has verifiable track records to a buhari who does not have a weac result and has failed woefully in handling his own personal businesses.

I believe obi who has led fidelity bank, next cash and carry,anambra,sec and the over 30 company boards he is currently on to lead Nigeria to the path of restoration and redemption.

I promise you all if obi becomes president Nigeria will change. And take this to the bank. He served anambra under APGA a relatively unknown party winning Pdp(I am sure you know how hard that was) and he had no member in the parliament. 
Do not underestimate Obi who rose to billionaire status on his own with stealing a dime from the people he is supposed to serve,unlike atiku and bola Ahmed thiefnibu

Obi is trying to serve Nigeria. The others want to be served.
While others are desperate and have the motion of ruling by all means.

Obi and datti are not. They are only desperate to make sure Nigeria works for us all.

Please for fairness, equality, justice and obidience to the rule of law, we should all make sure Obi gets to aso rock Gods willing 2023.

10/10/2022, 08:58 - +234 703 228 1127: Mordern software development is extremely complex, especially for an enterprise like a bank. There are alot of moving parts with so many things to consider.

I can understand why he feels that way. There are times when you think you got everything right, all your test passed, all the bugs caught at testing fixed.

When that same code gets to production, it takes one user to break your whole system because you didn't anticipate they will use your software in that way. 

You spend a whole day debugging, just to discover you created a static buffer in development and failed to make dynamic in prod.
Or in your attempt to use multi-threading, you forgot to lock the variable when one thread is writing to it, this in turn caused a grid lock because two thread wanted to write to it simultaneously.

The list goes on. These are non-trivial things understanding the data flow in your application, understanding when to use the appropriate data structure, when to pass by reference or pass by value e.t.c takes time, experience and dedication to master.
The pain and the on-ramp efforts should not be minimized. Software development is a very hard endeavor.

I don't want to  get into the expectations around deployment and infrastructure especially on-prem like most banks in Nigeria, that's another whole beast on its own.

10/10/2022, 19:01 - CraftLab: What makes the thing really crazy is that people who are abused stand a risk of themselves becoming abusers
10/10/2022, 19:01 - CraftLab: So what if those girls become abusers in the future?

What if they already are?
10/10/2022, 19:14 - Governor Tee: They become sex addicts
10/10/2022, 19:16 - CraftLab: Unless they get rehab
10/10/2022, 19:16 - CraftLab: You think maybe rehab could fix that emotional damage and baggage?
10/10/2022, 19:18 - Governor Tee: @2347061061033 can it?
10/10/2022, 19:19 - CraftLab: Also, do we have NGOs and hotlines for kids who have been victims of sexual abuse?

Peace ☮️
11/10/2022, 16:42 - Alozie Chidindu: Bro if you're unbiased as u claim you'd condem this political candidate
11/10/2022, 16:42 - Alozie Chidindu: You willingly wish people to grant a criminal the helm of Nigeria
11/10/2022, 16:43 - Governor Tee: Una don start
11/10/2022, 16:44 - Seun Adetoyi: Have I condemned any of the candidates?

I’m only saying do your investigation across board.

Same problem that has rendered our researches as undergraduates useless.
We only scrap the top.
No digging deep!
11/10/2022, 16:44 - Alozie Chidindu: My perogative is to challenge the norm, have difficult conversations that will push forward growth so YES I DON START
11/10/2022, 16:44 - Seun Adetoyi: Today that you came to office now. We no go hear word?
11/10/2022, 16:44 - Alozie Chidindu: That's not what you voiced to me
11/10/2022, 16:45 - Governor Tee: Limme na
11/10/2022, 16:45 - Alozie Chidindu: I commend your progressiveness non the less
11/10/2022, 16:45 - Seun Adetoyi: State it in my exact word or paraphrase it closely as you can what I said to you
11/10/2022, 16:46 - Seun Adetoyi: *as much as you can
11/10/2022, 16:47 - Alozie Chidindu: Ok you're first statement to which I was provoked, is your unwillingness to vote and hereby exercise an privly too which many would pay for that would affect our collective lives
11/10/2022, 16:49 - Alozie Chidindu: Secondly is your unwilling support for that which is good, which beckons on me asking  what your principles as a man (youn albeit) are?
11/10/2022, 16:49 - Seun Adetoyi: Lol, my decision not yours
11/10/2022, 16:49 - Alozie Chidindu: My life is hinged on your decision hence its not simple as you put it
11/10/2022, 16:50 - Seun Adetoyi: Because I’ve not found any worthy to support 
Hence my decision to serve as an umpire
11/10/2022, 16:50 - Seun Adetoyi: I be your life support?
11/10/2022, 16:50 - Alozie Chidindu: I must protect my future and that of my unborn kids even if all I can do is set a precedent
11/10/2022, 16:50 - Alozie Chidindu: That's what a collective is, we are each others life support
11/10/2022, 16:51 - Seun Adetoyi: All these your screams on my neck here
Go and convince 10agberos for Oshodi or rather go to CMS
11/10/2022, 16:52 - Alozie Chidindu: If I have the opportunity I will, but I don't. Guess who I have access to? That's you hence I'm trying it on you.
11/10/2022, 16:52 - Seun Adetoyi: You’ll make more sense 
I’ve made my own decision.
Hence trouble me no more!

Sai gobe!
11/10/2022, 16:52 - Seun Adetoyi: Lol
I can sponsor your t fare to Oshodi 
I’ll even order Bolt or Uber for you

11/10/2022, 16:55 - Alozie Chidindu: This has nothing to do with Peter OBI
11/10/2022, 16:55 - Alozie Chidindu: This is bag government before and after
11/10/2022, 16:56 - Alozie Chidindu: It's very hard to climb up but so easy to fall?
11/10/2022, 16:56 - Tashy Taofeek: Check the date sha
11/10/2022, 16:56 - Alozie Chidindu: Very difficult to build and very easy to destroy, why?
11/10/2022, 16:57 - Alozie Chidindu: Now what I'm trying to say is, obi came in did good and left, he isn't a messiah
11/10/2022, 16:57 - Alozie Chidindu: He isn't going to do a miraculous fix of a Nigeria
11/10/2022, 16:57 - Alozie Chidindu: But he is a precedent
11/10/2022, 16:57 - Alozie Chidindu: A precedent of good governance
11/10/2022, 16:58 - Alozie Chidindu: If we start with Peter obi, maybe we will once vote only capable integrity driven disciplined people
11/10/2022, 16:58 - Alozie Chidindu: I just need us to set a precedent

15/12/2022, 19:29 - .: Dear info sec/ Access control people

Kindly note, we don't implement any authentication and authorization schemes in our  apps oo. All we do is, call active directory through U-identity with the credentials the user provides. 
This usually returns true or false. 

True if the user credentials are correct and the user has access to that application, False if non of those conditions are true. 

Please we don't save user credentials or any user details in our apps, those details come from U-identity. 
Some questions are unnecessary during UAT plix. 

Sincerely 
A concerned Developer.

15/12/2022, 20:01 - .: I get what you are saying.

Here is the issue with this.
2FA in the bank is handled through digi pass and the new service that was just built (that's the mobile Token app).

The new service isn't completely live yet (I.e used bank wide) , we still doing Beta test. 

Also I don't know if digi pass has An Api/endpoint to validate the 2FA tied to the user's account.

So if a Developer wants to implement 2FA now, it means rolling out their own AuthN and AuthZ scheme which kind of defeats the purpose of a central AuthN and AuthZ scheme. 
That will still fail UAT too.

20/12/2022, 19:51 - CraftLab: I don't know. Maybe the creative process requires something dark.

If you check out creative history, most creatives have a dark side;

It's either substance abuse, a major vice or a dance between sanity and pure madness

They have the whole Library on a TOR network, here is the onion link:

http://zlibrary24tuxziyiyfr7zd46ytefdqbqd2axkmxm4o5374ptpc52fad.onion/

If you don't know how use the tor network, google it or DM.

Although it is no that hard, just download a TOR Browser and click on connect to be able to connect to the network.

Once connected, can enter that link in any-tab and it will open.

HINT: TOR Network is usually very slow because of the way it was built and it operates, so instead of downloading the file directly from there, opt in for the option to send it to your google drive then you can download it from there.

If confused, buzz me between the hours of 12am-3am only. (you can buzz me anytime) I will only answer you then.

800bn is still much in 5 years

26/12/2022, 15:02 - Sage: Many things come to context
26/12/2022, 15:03 - Sage: The way Nigerians handle the Naira
26/12/2022, 15:03 - Sage: Reduces life span of the bank notes

26/12/2022, 15:11 - Sage: U could check the production cost of some other countries...
26/12/2022, 15:14 - CraftLab: While I am not a supporter of this government, or the previous, or governments in general, I will admit that it's quite expensive maintaining paper currencies for a population as vast as ours, especially when you consider that everything in the process from the plates for minting to the trucks for transport are most likely imported.

Considering how trash the naira is especially as regards it's purchasing power for international transactions ₦800bn does seem fairly plausible. 

Given of course a little wriggle room for some stealing here and there
26/12/2022, 15:17 - CraftLab: Speaking of which, here's how much they spent in dollars, for context. 👇🏽

 *$1,791,191,760.00*
26/12/2022, 15:20 - Sage: U have made this computation with current fx rates
26/12/2022, 15:22 - Sage: Naira traded at 330 to dollar in 2017 as against 448 today
26/12/2022, 15:22 - CraftLab: Too lazy to do the breakdown across years and compute based on market trends and possibilities.

Given the gradual and near-absolute decline of the naira, that figure should be right, give or take a few million dollars.

You have better figures?
26/12/2022, 15:22 - Sage: Only saying it would be less...
26/12/2022, 15:25 - CraftLab: And I'm saying the difference wouldn't be much in the grand scheme of things

It's as powerful as  people say it is and it is only getting better.

Take it from sombody who has been playing with it everyday since they announced it.

So many Developers will loose their jobs cos of this.
29/12/2022, 10:31 - Emmanuel Enyo-ojo Amedu: I see it as an Auto pilot
29/12/2022, 10:35 - .: Lol it's more than that actually.

So while it can program itself or even analyze a complex business case and turn it to code (it can do for simple cases by the way)

It's just a matter of time before it gets there. (minus the programming itself part)

Also it will make programming so common that most people could do it.

Finally, fewer developers could get a lot done with it faster, eliminating the need for large expensive teams
29/12/2022, 10:38 - Emmanuel Enyo-ojo Amedu: Correction:
It will make programming so common that most people can copy and paste
29/12/2022, 10:42 - Emmanuel Enyo-ojo Amedu: Anyways, is the speed for me
29/12/2022, 10:42 - Emmanuel Enyo-ojo Amedu: Is crazy
29/12/2022, 10:48 - .: That's where you are wrong again.

Let me paint a picture for you.

I don't know anything about building a rendering engine, programming with rust.

But say I wanted to learn how to quickly build a 3D rendering engine, it's easier for me to move faster with this thingy.

I start by asking it how can I get started with building a 3d rendering engine in rust. 

It tells me, this is a complex task, not suited for beginners. 
I need to learn the basics of 3d modeling, computer graphics, coordinate geometry. 

Then I need to learn the basics of rust programming language. 

I now ask a follow-up question, based on the current context, 

Give a 20 mins lesson on the basics of computer graphics 

I gives me a detailed lesson, I move on to the next topic, until I exhaust all thr topics it listed (that's including the programming language). I could continue but I believe you see where I am going with this. 

The point is, it's easy to move from Zero to creator with it (while knowing what you are doing), just know the right questions to ask.

It's more targeted and results are more accurate that 100 of hours of googling. 

It's easy to deep dive quickly and move fast even for beginners.

05/01/2023, 18:22 - Alozie Chidindu: Everyone let's talk bias. We build ML models we attempt generalisation but how do we account for bias especially those we embedded in our models by the way we think(are biased)
05/01/2023, 18:23 - Governor Tee: Una don start this year
05/01/2023, 18:23 - Alozie Chidindu: This is a real life danger. It is life threatening and can get worse

05/01/2023, 18:27 - Alozie Chidindu: In US banks algorithms that recommend loans have been found to be biased for colored people...this isn't just trying to get money to buy a house this is now far reaching consequence that endangers a life
05/01/2023, 18:28 - Alozie Chidindu: Imagine he was killed on arrest or in jail. Look up the chances of black men being killed in jail
05/01/2023, 18:37 - FAOK: <Media omitted>
05/01/2023, 18:59 - CraftLab: One of the major problems with ML and indeed all human innovations is the issue of bias.

A lot of the algorithms being built today display some form of bias towards people of colour and this sometimes comes about by accident, for example when the model is trained and built using a variety of white faced but little or no coloured representation in its data, it would fumble cases with coloured people more

A very popular and embarassing example of this is the self driving vehicles - there have been recorded instances of self driving vehicles not 'seeing' people of colour and ramming to them, resulting in some fantastic accidents and splendid lawsuits.

The truth is that unless we get to the utopian ideal of equal representation across the tech industry and innovations, we will continue to have issues and fumbles from the machines and systems we build.

That said, please it's a new year, let's not start plenty talk, t for thanks
05/01/2023, 19:00 - CraftLab: The utopian ideal may never happen by the way, and if it does, definitely not in this generation

16/01/2023, 15:12 - CraftLab: What is wrong with the mobile app abeg
16/01/2023, 15:13 - CraftLab: How am I just getting an OTP for a request I made by 11?
16/01/2023, 15:15 - Cholo: Network issue
16/01/2023, 15:17 - CraftLab: Toh. So this is what our customers are facing, presumably.
16/01/2023, 15:17 - CraftLab: This isn't good for business
16/01/2023, 15:18 - Cholo: It’s either the bank’s network provider is having issue or the customer network (most likely the issue)
16/01/2023, 15:19 - CraftLab: I'm the customer and my network is just fine
16/01/2023, 15:22 - Cholo: You know it’s more like and handshake type of stuff, the banks service provider might not be the same with your own service provider, hence the delay
16/01/2023, 15:22 - CraftLab: So how do we fix that? It's annoying
16/01/2023, 15:22 - CraftLab: The OTP had expired before it even came in
16/01/2023, 15:23 - Cholo: Eg let’s say Union uses airtel, and you use MTN, your otp doesn’t go directly to you. It goes through  MTN before it gets to you….
16/01/2023, 15:23 - Cholo: Hard token would solve the issue
16/01/2023, 15:25 - CraftLab: I understand the problem but it's still unresolved
16/01/2023, 15:25 - CraftLab: And what's the assurance that a hard token would actually be effective?

Before I incur additional cost to still see shege
16/01/2023, 15:26 - Cholo: It would work just like how you use it to access servers/application
16/01/2023, 15:27 - CraftLab: I don't use one.

Explain like to an 8 year old
16/01/2023, 15:29 - Cholo: So rather than that whole OTP routing process before it comes to you, the token would be mapped to your mobile app profile so when you want to do any transaction, you just press the button on the token which will generate an otp immediate for you and you input and it works
16/01/2023, 15:30 - Cholo: A token life span about 6 years tho
16/01/2023, 15:30 - Cholo: So it’s worth it
16/01/2023, 15:30 - CraftLab: Do you have one?
16/01/2023, 15:32 - Cholo: Yeah but I use it for zenith
16/01/2023, 15:32 - CraftLab: All right then.

17/01/2023, 20:00 - CraftLab: Phrasing, speech patterns (also reflected when we type) and the clarity of your request all affect the result you get.

The end
17/01/2023, 20:07 - Alozie Chidindu: Emmanuel 0 - 1 chatGPT
17/01/2023, 20:07 - Alozie Chidindu: 🫣
17/01/2023, 20:18 - Emmanuel Enyo-ojo Amedu: When u are writing a test, is this how a question is asked?
17/01/2023, 20:21 - CraftLab: ChatGPT is not human. It would be illogical to test it by human standards.

That said, it still got the answer correctly though
17/01/2023, 20:37 - Emmanuel Enyo-ojo Amedu: U already explained the answers for him
17/01/2023, 20:45 - Alozie Chidindu: <Media omitted>
17/01/2023, 20:52 - CraftLab: I did not. I asked the same question but in a simpler manner
17/01/2023, 20:53 - CraftLab: Also, ChatGPT's pronouns are "it"

Don't assign a gender to it, it's not human or even a biological being
17/01/2023, 21:02 - David UBN: To be fair, you kind of did answer the question when you explicitly stated it was a riddle

I think I saw somewhere in the image where the interface notes a riddle request has been made

If you give it that many explicit details, then it doesn't take much for the model to run through its data banks and find the appropriate logic to be applied to arrive at the answer.
17/01/2023, 21:03 - David UBN: Also Emmanuel please stop bullying the AI that may or may not unalive/unfreedomize most of humanity one day.
17/01/2023, 21:03 - Alozie Chidindu: Saying its a riddle isn't answering the question its giving context
17/01/2023, 21:03 - Alozie Chidindu: This is a phenomenon in programming aka context switching
17/01/2023, 21:04 - Alozie Chidindu: But the question was too easy he laid it out
17/01/2023, 21:04 - CraftLab: You get???
17/01/2023, 21:04 - David UBN: Which in this case is practically answering the question since it now has a reference point
17/01/2023, 21:04 - David UBN: ChatGPT I'm sorry for calling you an "it". I'm not one of them please.
17/01/2023, 21:05 - Alozie Chidindu: We will get there one day for now context matters
17/01/2023, 21:05 - Alozie Chidindu: Wtf
17/01/2023, 21:05 - Alozie Chidindu: It's not sentient
17/01/2023, 21:05 - David UBN: As far as you know...
17/01/2023, 21:05 - Alozie Chidindu: <Media omitted>
17/01/2023, 21:06 - CraftLab: Which boils back to my previous assertion - ChatGPT is just code, what's there to gain from making your request unnecessarily difficult?

It's modelled to be a virtual assistant, not a mind reader, and if you can't communicate what you want clearly enough, you're bound to hit a snag
17/01/2023, 21:08 - David UBN: It's character development. Unnecessary suffering/confusion and violent stupidity is part of the package deal if your goal is to mimic human intelligence.
17/01/2023, 21:09 - CraftLab: So which of these problems would you classify @2347068795337's request as?
17/01/2023, 21:12 - David UBN: @2347068795337 Laolu works on the right wing of the 21st floor, 2nd desk on the second row from the entrance just behind the nice glass corner office. 

On a totally unrelated note.

17/01/2023, 21:13 - Emmanuel Enyo-ojo Amedu: Thanks a million for the info

17/01/2023, 21:14 - David UBN: If all goes well, it is your teeth that will cut.

MINISTRY OF TRANSPORTATION
 
PRESS RELEASE
 
LASG ANNOUNCES TRAFFIC DIVERSION IN PREPARATION FOR MR. PRESIDENT’S VISIT
 
The Lagos State Government has announced that traffic will be restricted on Monday 23rd January with diversion on the Island on Tuesday 24th January, 2023 in preparation for the visit of Mr. President to Lagos State.

In a statement released by the Lagos State Ministry of Transportation, the Commissioner, Dr. Frederic Oladeinde assured that alternative routes have been mapped out as well as the deployment of the State Traffic Management Authority, LASTMA to manage Traffic flow during the 2 day visit.

Explaining the routes that would be manned by the LASTMA Personnel, the Commissioner stated that; on the First day which is Monday 23rd, movement around Lagos Rice Mill, Imota in Ikorodu, and the Lekki Deep Port Sea axis will be restricted.

While on the Second day which is Tuesday 24th, movement around Eko Hotels and Suites, Ahmadu Bello Way, J-Randle through to Broad Street and Outer Marina will be diverted from 6.00am to 3.00pm.

Pleading with Motorists for their cooperation, Oladeinde highlighted the alternative routes made available as options for Motorists depending on the desired destinations. 

The options according to the movement plan will have Motorists diverted from Ahmadu Bello Way, Ademola Adetokunbo and Akin Adesola Street to Falomo Bridge (Five Cowries Bridge), to Alfred Rewane Road to connect their desired destinations.

While Motorists that are Onikan bound from Ozumba Mbadiwe and Bonny Camp are enjoined to make use of Falomo Bridge (Five Cowries Bridge) or Awolowo Road.

The Transport Commissioner further stated that Motorists from Awolowo Road heading to Onikan Roundabout, Tinubu Square or any other part of the inner Island will make use of Falomo Roundabout to link Alfred Rewane to further their journeys.

Another diversion option made available according to the statement is for Motorists from King George V Road to connect Moloney Street and then Obalende for their desired destinations, or alternatively link Turton Street through Moloney Street to Lewis and Sandgrouse Streets.

For the Motorists from Eko Bridge trying to link Marina, they will be diverted to Elegbata, Ebute Ero to Police Post to link the 3rd Mainland Bridge (Adeniji Adele) to further connect their desired destinations.

While stressing that all the adjourning Streets leading to the dedicated routes for the movement of Mr. President will be temporarily closed, Oladeinde assures motorists of a well mapped out strategy to minimize delays and inconveniences of road users.

22/01/2023, 22:09 - Emmanuel Enyo-ojo Amedu: The word best person for the job doesn't mean he's perfect. He's only a better option among the options presented before us.

Yet some people in their right senses still clamour for those that have put us in this dare situation to continue their animosity towards Nigerians and Nigeria. It's thought-provoking! 
We must not regroup to foster inefficiency, ineptitude, corruption and those who keep wanting to finish our commonwealth again.

Vote wisely!

24/01/2023, 18:26 - Isaac UBN: How you know say na three letters
24/01/2023, 18:26 - CraftLab: 1. Where's this data sourced from?
2. What were the metrics used in measuring them?
3. While I do not in any way support the present APC government, fact remains that the COVID 19 pandemic was a major setback to the nation's progress and economy. Oil prices (our major source of income) hit negative values during this period and many oil-focused economies suffered a drastic hit as well
24/01/2023, 18:27 - CraftLab: Whenever there's an election to be held, all of a sudden _data_ starts flying everywhere and people start calling figures.
Where was all this information before the election?
24/01/2023, 18:32 - CraftLab: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/20/business/oil-prices.html

A quick read on what negative oil prices mean and how it impacted the global economy
25/01/2023, 10:42 - Sage: Smiles...
25/01/2023, 10:50 - Sage: A negative oil price for just a day or hrs ... comrade find a better excuse...

Like budget cost for managing our COVID-19 cases, buying of vaccines and provisions of palliatives for the masses.
25/01/2023, 11:05 - CraftLab: It wasn't for a day. For almost a month or so.
And global trading of crude happens everyday so yeah, it's not the joke you're trying to make of it
25/01/2023, 11:10 - Sage: Seriously
25/01/2023, 11:11 - Sage: Just went to read about it
25/01/2023, 11:12 - Sage: Nigeria's oil is Brent... which didn't go negative.

The oil price that went negative was WTI mainly from texas USA
25/01/2023, 11:12 - CraftLab: Yeah. I followed the oil price slump for an article/advisory at the time
25/01/2023, 11:13 - Sage: Just saying that oil price is not to be used as an excuse for where we are as a country
25/01/2023, 11:13 - Sage: Ahbi Saudi no follow de sell the oil
25/01/2023, 11:13 - CraftLab: The story is bigger than the US, check around you'll see
25/01/2023, 11:14 - Sage: Same oil 🛢️ wey dem bin de steal
25/01/2023, 11:15 - CraftLab: I did not say it's an excuse sir, I said while we are villifying the APC for where they have landed us, we should also consider the challenges they faced as well.
Given, they bungled things, but still truth must be told
25/01/2023, 11:16 - CraftLab: Saudi Arabia as a country has a better continuity plan than Nigeria, but they still faced their own fair share of crisis
25/01/2023, 11:16 - Sage: And truth to u 
Is that oil prices went negative on a crude oil grade we don't have..
25/01/2023, 11:16 - Sage: Wow
25/01/2023, 11:17 - CraftLab: How did you read what I said and arrive at that?
Are you trying to have a conversation or do you just want to be right?

25/01/2023, 11:19 - CraftLab: Just google it fa
25/01/2023, 11:22 - Sage: Comrade we don't have WTI in Nigeria.
And I am saying that the Brent we have didn't go negative...
And by u...the wahala lasted for 1month...

Should this now justify our
Poverty index
Unemployment ratio
Price index
And fx rates??

This is a humble inquiry
25/01/2023, 11:22 - Sage: I did
25/01/2023, 11:25 - Sage: The end goal of a conversation should not be sharing of wrong info from both parties 🤣🤣...

One has to prove the validity of his statement...

31/01/2023, 14:41 - Nonso: CBN is trying to control cash flow that's one of the purpose for this change
31/01/2023, 14:41 - Kayode: and so of all the problems mentioned in the article from the CBN governors speech it's so that Bu-Bu-Bu Bullion Van Tinubu cannot change money that they changed currency 😂😂

Also my mother should be celebrating my birthday not me. It was her achievement not mine.

Lastly the idea that I will regret not celebrating my birthday when I get old just sounds ridiculous to me. Say for example, I bow out of peer pressure and decide to celebrate it, I will just be forcing myself to enjoy it.

Would you advice me to spend money and time engaging in an activity I don't find interesting?

Maybe as I grow Older and probably lonlier, my perception about this might change but for now, I geniuly don't care about it.
08/02/2023, 13:40 - +234 809 169 4399: Wow so you lied to me yesterday?

08/02/2023, 13:48 - Nonso: Okey go tell us
08/02/2023, 13:48 - Mike: You are wrong on this...

First it is not about getting a spotlight.

It is about celebration of life. 

You mentioned it is your Mum that should be celebrating. So you don't deserve to celebrate yourself by being a year older every year? Common man. 

I don't make noise about my birthday too but I have learnt to always reflect about my life and how far the Lord has brought.

On a last note, Life is a blessing and should be appreciated everyday
08/02/2023, 13:57 - Kami: When he has kids. He’ll celebrate that achievement. This one is his parents achievement. The logic >>>>>>

There are things I enjoy doing, celebrating a birthday or having people make a fuss about it isn't one of them.

I don't know why we're having this discussion self...
It don't matter what I say, you will never relate.

Maybe someday I will feel different about it but for now naah. 

Just to be clear, If I have a who cared about theirs, I will make the effort to show up for them cos I care about them.

10/02/2023, 22:53 - Governor Tee: And to think we spent hours brainstorming only for them to commonly wave it away with the “we will look into it “ excuse
10/02/2023, 22:54 - Governor Tee: Since august they are still looking into it
10/02/2023, 22:56 - Governor Tee: Comrade you have not moved on?

17/02/2023, 21:32 - Mike: Wow
17/02/2023, 21:33 - Mike: So next week is not sure that we will be in the office
17/02/2023, 21:34 - Governor Tee: Trust union bank to come up with a way to bring staffs
17/02/2023, 21:41 - Mike: Mehn, I no carry my PC with me
17/02/2023, 21:42 - Governor Tee: Way number 1
18/02/2023, 08:39 - CraftLab: Can bankers form part of a union? Not sure but I think essential workers are excluded from such, and if I remember well, y'all are essential workers
18/02/2023, 08:40 - Governor Tee: It’d be easier if essential worker are provided with cash
Cos right now there seem not to be any difference between essential and not so essential
18/02/2023, 08:45 - CraftLab: In a sane, functional democracy essential workers are afforded certain privileges by the nature of their jobs...













but this is Nigeria
18/02/2023, 11:06 - Isaac UBN: Forget ooo, Essential workers get union. Electricity workers are essential workers, they are part of different unions and they go on strike, just that they inform a lot of organizations and bodies before embanking on it. this is to prevent industrial action against them.
18/02/2023, 11:09 - Isaac UBN: NOTE their strike does not last for 24 hours before government will come in
18/02/2023, 11:11 - Isaac UBN: Strike is one of the few things this government listen to, they listen to Dialogue

19/02/2023, 16:38 - CraftLab: All these conversations around how the world would be so different in XYZ number of days usually just sound overreaching to me
19/02/2023, 16:40 - CraftLab: By the turn of the millennium, every expected that the world would be such a different place in Y2K, flying cars, huge advances in science and technology and whatnot. 
But look at us, now in 2023 and we still haven't found a cure to cancer. Change is not that easy to achieve, and is also hard to implement.

20/02/2023, 20:35 - Mofifoluwa Aiyepola: You can argue respectfully. What is all this cussing and unnecessary bickering for?

23/02/2023, 11:58 - Emmanuel Enyo-ojo Amedu: *Since Emefiele has been the most mentioned name in Nigeria in the last few weeks, I think Oxford Dictionary should consider creating a space for him in the dictionary*.

*For example*:
Emefiele / eme-fi-ele/ adjective: hard, difficult.
Verb: Emefiele
Past Tense: Emefieled
Present Continuous: Emefieleing
Present Perfect: Emefielize*
😂😂😂
*E.g:*
... Some guys always like to emefielize  things
... The test was emefielistic
... I had a very emefielized week.
😂😂😂
*#Emefiele*:  To complicate, make things worse, unbearable.
😂😂😂
*E.g:*
... Please don't come and emeficate issues here.
... The only way to reduce applicants is to emeficate  the process
... How was your exam? It was emefielic!!
😂😂😂...

24/02/2023, 07:33 - Alozie Chidindu: Troubled with thoughts nvm silly me
24/02/2023, 07:36 - CraftLab: At this point it's kinda late for aspersions and accusations. People who will vote will vote, and they already know who they're voting for.
Unless it's a purely academic discourse in which case I'd say that having ties to the LGBTQIA community does not mean anything in Nigeria. A lot of those in power are closet homosexuals already and the 14 year jail term is a joke
24/02/2023, 07:36 - Alozie Chidindu: True
24/02/2023, 07:37 - Alozie Chidindu: So I true, our kids will be openly gay.
24/02/2023, 07:37 - Alozie Chidindu: As it will set precedent for future administration
24/02/2023, 07:40 - CraftLab: Some of them already are. There are several openly gay Nigerians living in Nigeria on social media. Some of them even share every aspect of their lives on social media yet nothing happens.

Bobrisky openly admits to having sex for cash, have they arrested him/her yet?
24/02/2023, 07:41 - CraftLab: If it will make us more honest with ourselves then so be it
24/02/2023, 07:41 - Alozie Chidindu: I'm talking big picture here like 3 out of every 5 students might be openly gay
24/02/2023, 07:42 - Alozie Chidindu: It didn't help Americans
24/02/2023, 07:42 - CraftLab: More women for the rest of us
24/02/2023, 07:42 - CraftLab: Don't puncture my hopes yet
24/02/2023, 07:42 - Alozie Chidindu: Sure but the decadence phew
24/02/2023, 07:42 - Alozie Chidindu: Lol
24/02/2023, 07:46 - CraftLab: Let's be honest, acceptance of the gay community won't turn anyone gay, all it means is that they would come out of hiding.
What that means is that gay people can get married, hold pride events and tell everyone how gay they are. Cool.
It also means people won't have to fake marriages, you would be able to identify gay people and avoid hitting on people who don't swing like you do.

If each sexual orientation can keep to itself and avoid being overtly aggressive or punctilious, we'll all get along swimmingly my good man.

Sadly, this is Nigeria and history warns otherwise
24/02/2023, 07:48 - Alozie Chidindu: Ok

07/03/2023, 21:22 - David UBN: Most of us don't, but we live regardless. Finding a reason to bear it until we start to want it.

"Draw attention to yourself by creating an unforgettable, even controversial image. Court scandal. Do anything to make yourself seem larger than life and shine more brightly than those around you. Make no distinction between kinds of attention—notoriety of any sort will bring you power. Better to be slandered and attacked than ignored.
At the beginning of your rise, spend all your energy on attracting attention.  The quality of attention is irrelevant"

These people are smarter than we give them credit for.
14/03/2023, 23:00 - .: Nobody knew Portable until he started doing rubbish.

 Even though people  abhorred what he was doing, it made them more curious anytime they heard his name on the news.
14/03/2023, 23:25 - Charles Ekeh: You're right when you say nobody knew portable until he started doing rubbish... so will you cast your vote for portable if he was running for the elections? 

It's good to be known, but what are you known for?

Even the blind can see how desperate Sanwo Olu is at thee moment,  he's being known for his desperation to be the governor... same way Desmond. Eliot now I claiming igbo boy....

We will see at the end where their desperate acts will land them

Let's us still use this example. Sure I might not vote somebody like him but I bet you, if you and Portable contest for an election in this Nigeria, I like his chances better than you.

Also about your assumption that his rubbish will lead him to a bad place, you can't say that for sure. What you can say with absolute certainty is that his rubbish is currently leading him to fame and money.

This is not Nollywood. Bad behavior is rewarded with applause here in the real world.

There's a lot of noise and the narrative isn't very clear
18/03/2023, 15:34 - CraftLab: *thugs
18/03/2023, 15:35 - Emmanuel Enyo-ojo Amedu: They are fighting the thugs, since the police aren't doing anything
18/03/2023, 15:36 - CraftLab: Okay. And with that explanation, I'll assume that the fellow on the ground is one of said thugs, yes?
18/03/2023, 15:37 - Emmanuel Enyo-ojo Amedu: Yeah

19/03/2023, 18:47 - FAOK: Smh
19/03/2023, 18:51 - Governor Tee: Tchew

19/03/2023, 19:04 - CraftLab: Made me happy when I heard it
19/03/2023, 19:05 - CraftLab: The little wins are still wins. And to think this happened in the North, which most would think of as the headquarters of patriarchy in Nigeria
19/03/2023, 19:07 - CraftLab: Speaking of which, my apologies to @2347058563520, I did not believe you at first when you were speaking about the marginalisation of Igbo people (due to personal experience and exposure I thought otherwise) but now I see that you have a valid point, at least in Lagos state
19/03/2023, 19:07 - CraftLab: I'm yet to be persuaded on your conspiracy theories about the white people though
19/03/2023, 19:12 - Alozie Chidindu: I'm delighted by your exposure...I hope we have more uncomfortable conversations that will shapen the future.
19/03/2023, 19:12 - Alozie Chidindu: Lol
19/03/2023, 19:14 - CraftLab: To truth and enlightenment. However uncomfortable they might be 🍻
19/03/2023, 19:15 - CraftLab: I'm not sure if you hate them or just want to be them 👀
19/03/2023, 19:16 - Alozie Chidindu: Ever loved someone so much you want to be them and then subsequently hate them cos of no matter how much you tried you couldn't
19/03/2023, 19:16 - Alozie Chidindu: That's my relationship with the whites.
19/03/2023, 19:17 - CraftLab: Can't relate. Learnt early in life to curb my appetites
19/03/2023, 19:17 - Alozie Chidindu: You can't be white, they don't curb shit over here
19/03/2023, 19:18 - CraftLab: Toh. You'll be fine.
There's a way out though, you can marry white
19/03/2023, 19:18 - CraftLab: No, I don't think I could. Or rather, I think that if I were white, I wouldn't be the same person I am right now
19/03/2023, 19:20 - Alozie Chidindu: In the pipeline
19/03/2023, 19:20 - CraftLab: Can you blame them though? When you're born a part of the problem, it is extremely difficult to dissociate properly enough to see what is wrong. You take your privileges as normal, and the oppression of others as necessary because it is all you know.
And this is not just for the white people, Yorubas who think Igbos should be marginalised are prime examples of this too
19/03/2023, 19:20 - Alozie Chidindu: Met one yesterday, seemed keen to get married
19/03/2023, 19:20 - CraftLab: Ah 😂

19/03/2023, 19:26 - CraftLab: Their culture would take some mental adjustment to get used to though.

The whole gender spectrum would be a whole new experience
19/03/2023, 19:27 - CraftLab: Biggest culture shock may be meeting openly trans people for the first time. Both the ones who are genuine and those who do it for unfair advantages
19/03/2023, 19:28 - Seun Adetoyi: You guys should do this in each other’s DM na 🤦‍♂️
19/03/2023, 19:28 - Alozie Chidindu: Bro. I believe that. But who am I to stop the progress started by my ancestors. Openness and inclusiveness
19/03/2023, 19:28 - Alozie Chidindu: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
19/03/2023, 19:29 - Alozie Chidindu: In a bit
19/03/2023, 19:31 - CraftLab: No 😂
19/03/2023, 19:32 - CraftLab: Openness and inclusiveness indeed. Like you have a choice 😌
19/03/2023, 19:32 - CraftLab: We live in interesting times my guy

19/03/2023, 19:41 - CraftLab: First?

Nah being born in Nigeria was the first
19/03/2023, 19:42 - CraftLab: I have such high hopes for the future, especially in terms of biotech and a more cohesive form of global development
19/03/2023, 19:46 - Mofifoluwa Aiyepola: Quick question. Do we have access to Microsoft’s copilot?
19/03/2023, 19:47 - CraftLab: What's that?
19/03/2023, 19:49 - Mofifoluwa Aiyepola: Think of it as chatgpt plus office tools. So you have an excel file, copilot can analyze it and do a report either in word or PowerPoint
19/03/2023, 19:50 - CraftLab: Oh wow
19/03/2023, 19:50 - CraftLab: I looked it up
19/03/2023, 19:51 - CraftLab: That's cool! Hope stallion springs for it
19/03/2023, 19:51 - Alozie Chidindu: Lol
19/03/2023, 19:51 - Mofifoluwa Aiyepola: I’m too lazy to go digging into whether or not this is something we have access to
19/03/2023, 19:52 - FAOK: @2348061546341
19/03/2023, 19:52 - Alozie Chidindu: Microsoft has integrated it into most of their suite. Needs to be upgraded tho so NO
19/03/2023, 19:53 - Mofifoluwa Aiyepola: <Media omitted>
19/03/2023, 19:53 - CraftLab: I don't get. Are you saying that all we need to do is to update our apps?
19/03/2023, 19:53 - Alozie Chidindu: Yes
19/03/2023, 19:53 - Alozie Chidindu: See you understand
19/03/2023, 19:54 - CraftLab: Then that's not so hard now is it?
19/03/2023, 19:54 - Alozie Chidindu: Lol
19/03/2023, 19:58 - +234 806 154 6341: I'm not sure but I strongly believe we don't have access yet. We use enterprise edition and it's based on licenses. And trust me if I tell you we pay heavily for those licenses and that's why it's rationed and the co-pilot feature might not be free on enterprise edition which means not everyone might eventually have access to it.
19/03/2023, 19:59 - Alozie Chidindu: It is not free. 💯

Our plan is currently E5 so yes once it goes GA we will have access to it.

16/07/2023, 19:17 - Nonso👑: It's very important to know that there are limits to every shit, u can insult me and I won't even bother but insulting infosec as a whole, that's too extreme...

And by the way its wisdom to have funds in ur other bank accounts in case of service failure or network issue such as the one we're currently experiencing.

So what's wrong with the advice I gave???

16/07/2023, 19:22 - Emmanuel Enyo-ojo Amedu: I didn't border to respond to ur dm bcus I just realized you are a weak Comrade.

1. There is one thing this group is known for, cruise. If you are strong at giving, you should also be strong at collecting, else exit. PS: I didn't insult you or your team, it's called banter not insult.

2. Nothing is wrong with your advice, and I didn't complain.

Lagos State Government, in conjunction with the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing, has announced a temporary closure of the Alaka/Costain - Iganmu section of the Eko Bridge (Inward Island) for a period of 40 days commencing on Sunday, 23rd July, 2023.

A statement signed by the Permanent Secretary, Lagos State Ministry of Transportation, Engr. Abdulahfiz Toriola said the closure is a result of the damage noticed on some parts of the bridge structures which needed to be urgently rehabilitated to restore the integrity of the bridge.

He further disclosed that the Service Lane of the bridge leading to Iponri will be available for Motorists plying the route from Western Avenue and its environs.

While appreciating Motorists for their usual cooperation, Engr. Toriola advised road users to cooperate with the Traffic-Management Personnel deployed to the area to guide them appropriately while plying the axis.

26/07/2023, 06:28 - Emmanuel Enyo-ojo Amedu: I Ibrahim hamza, 
“I received a call from someone claiming it was from my mobile service provider and they asked me to turn off my phone for 2 hours for the 4G/5G update to take effect.  was rushing for a meeting, I turned off my cell phone.

After 45 minutes, I felt very suspicious since the caller did not even introduce his name to me.  I quickly turned on my cell phone and saw several messages from family members and the numbers of other callers who had called me earlier.  I called my parents and was shocked that they were very worried and asking if I am safe.  My parents told me that they had received a call a while earlier from someone claiming that they were holding me with them and asking for money to set me free.  The call was so real that my parents even heard "my voice" crying out loud and asking for help.  My father had gone to the bank waiting for the next call to transfer the money they requested.  I told my parents that I was safe and asked them to go and report to the police.

Right after that I got another call from the guy asking me to turn off my cell phone for another hour, which I refused to do and he hung up.  They kept calling on the cell phone to keep my phone busy so that others could not reach me and until the cell phone battery ran out.  I had gone to the police myself and learned from the police officer that there were a lot of these scams reported.
 Most cases reported that the victim had already transferred the money!  And it is impossible to get the money back.  Be careful because this kind of scam could happen to any of us !!!

These guys are so professional, very convincing during their calls.  If you are asked to turn off your cell phone for updates by a service provider, don't listen!

Your family or friends might get the same call.  Please notify them

"Be safe and stay alert!

Please pass this information on to your family and friends !!!

It is not enough to just read, but also to share.

08/08/2023, 22:40 - .: Dear Software Engineer,

Start exploring Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools such as *Semantic Kernel*, *Guidance*, *Hugging Face*, and *Vector Databases*. I recently came across an article on HackerRank titled "The Rise of the AI Engineer," and it's not what it sounds like.

The term is actually referring to regular software engineers who are using NLP tools to orchestrate AI workloads. This will soon become the new normal. The world will need more software engineers to build AI-powered solutions, rather than more machine learning engineers to create new models.
08/08/2023, 22:59 - Nathan: AI has always been software engineering
